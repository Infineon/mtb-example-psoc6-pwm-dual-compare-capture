# PSoC&trade; 6 MCU: TCPWM in PWM mode with dual compare/capture

This code example demonstrates the generation of asymmetric PWM signals using two compare/capture registers available in the TCPWM block of the PSoC 6 MCU devices. Compared to the asymmetric PWM realized with only one compare function (where the CPU is used to update the compare value twice every PWM cycle), this solution uses two independent buffered compare values and causes less load on the CPU (where the CPU is used to update the compare value once every PWM cycle). This document discusses these advantages and application in field-oriented control (FOC).

## Using the code example

Create the project and open it using one of the following:

<details><summary><b>In Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox</b></summary>

1. Click the **New Application** link in the **Quick Panel** (or, use **File** > **New** > **ModusToolbox Application**). This launches the [Project Creator](http://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxProjectCreator) tool.

2. Pick a kit supported by the code example from the list shown in the **Project Creator - Choose Board Support Package (BSP)** dialog.

   When you select a supported kit, the example is reconfigured automatically to work with the kit. To work with a different supported kit later, use the [Library Manager](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxLibraryManager) to choose the BSP for the supported kit. You can use the Library Manager to select or update the BSP and firmware libraries used in this application. To access the Library Manager, click the link from the **Quick Panel**.

   You can also just start the application creation process again and select a different kit.

   If you want to use the application for a kit not listed here, you may need to update the source files. If the kit does not have the required resources, the application may not work.

3. In the **Project Creator - Select Application** dialog, choose the example by enabling the checkbox.

4. Optionally, change the suggested **New Application Name**.

5. The **Application(s) Root Path** defaults to the Eclipse workspace which is usually the desired location for the application. If you want to store the application in a different location, you can change the *Application(s) Root Path* value. Applications that share libraries should be in the same root path.

6. Click **Create** to complete the application creation process.

For more details, see the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox user guide](https://www.cypress.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox install directory}/ide_{version}/docs/mt_ide_user_guide.pdf*).

## Debugging

You can debug the example to step through the code. In the IDE, use the **\<Application Name> Debug (KitProg3_MiniProg4)** configuration in the **Quick Panel**. For more details, see the "Program and debug" section in the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox User Guide](https://www.cypress.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide).

**Note:** **(Only while debugging)** On the CM4 CPU, some code in `main()` may execute before the debugger halts at the beginning of `main()`. This means that some code executes twice - once before the debugger stops execution, and again after the debugger resets the program counter to the beginning of `main()`. See [KBA231071](https://community.cypress.com/docs/DOC-21143) to learn about this and for the workaround.

## Design and implementation

This code example demonstrates generating asymmetric PWM signals using dual compare/capture. The configuration required for the TCPWM block are done in a custom *design.modus* file.

An asymmetric PWM signal is a center-aligned PWM, which is shifted either to the left or right. In this mode, the counter counts up until its counter value reaches the period and then counts down until it becomes zero (repeats itself). The value in the CC0 register is used as a match when counting up, and the value in the CC1 register is used as a match when counting down. When the counter value matches the CC0 register value, the PWM signal goes HIGH and when counter value matches CC1 register value, the PWM signal goes LOW. Thus, by having different CC0 and CC1 register values, you can generate asymmetric PWM signals of any width and phase.

**Figure 7. TCPWM configurations in custom design file**

![](images/tcpwm-config.jpg)

The Debug UART is used to accept commands from the terminal. A callback is generated upon every command received. The CC0_Buff and CC1_Buff register values are modified according to the command. A swap is then triggered to exchange CC and CC_Buff values.

The advantage of using dual compare/capture registers to generate asymmetric PWM signals is the reduction in CPU bandwidth usage. With only one CC register, the application must write new values to CC_Buff registers every half a cycle. With two CC registers, the application need to write new values to CC_Buff registers only once every cycle, thereby reducing the CPU bandwidth usage by half.

Asymmetric PWMs are widely used in field-oriented control to drive gates of MOSFET bridges. The duty cycle of the PWM signals is modulated in the form of a sine wave to generate the required vectors. Asymmetric PWMs are used to introduce temporary phase shifts to measure single-shunt current. The single-shunt design reduces the cost and complexity of the motor control application significantly.
